# Usage
Access the website below. When opened, the user is presented with a landing page with a link that opens the notes page that shows existing notes listed in the left-hand column, and empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. When the save icon in the top navigation bar is clicked, the newly entered note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with other existing notes.

When clicking on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column. When clicking on the Write icon in the top navigation bar, the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.
